delete.py — Delete real estate data for a specific season and optional city.

Removes matching records from transactions, rentals, and etl_log.
This is a destructive operation — only invoked manually via GitHub Actions.

CLI usage:
    python etl/scripts/delete.py --season 112S1
    python etl/scripts/delete.py --season 112S1 --city A
    python etl/scripts/delete.py --season 112S1 --city A,F,H
